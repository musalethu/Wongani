## Introduction 

I will share a little about react introduction

## Body 

### What is react js?

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end JavaScript library for building uer interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.React can be used as a base in the development fo single-page or mobile applications.

React's concept:

- Components
- JSX
- State 
- Props

### Components

A component is one isolated piece of interface. For example in a typical blog homepage you might find the Sidebar component, and the Blog Posts List component. They are in turn composed by components themselves, so you could have a list of Blog post components, each for every blog post, and each with its own peculiar properties.

### JSX 

JSX is an extension to JavaScript which allows you to declaratively create custom UI components. JSX has important benefits:
- Easy, declarative markup.
- Colocated with your component.
- Separate by concern, (e.g., UI vs state logic, vs side-effects) not by technology (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Abstract away DOM differences.
- Abstract away from underlying tech so you can target many different platforms with React.

### Conclusion 

React is a little bit hard to understand but I think as time goes it will be clear.

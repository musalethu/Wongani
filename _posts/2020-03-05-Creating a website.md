### What's a Website 

A website is a collection of publicly accessible, linked Web pages that share a single domain name. Websites can be created and maintained by an individual, group, business, or organization to serve a variety of purposes. Together, all publicly accessible websites constitute the World Wide Web. 

### Creating a website

Creating a website requires you to have a certain thing in mind like having a domain name that will allow people to connect to your website, also a website building software that you will use to create a website, and also you should have a website template. You should also know CSS and HTML to have a beautiful and presentable.

## Problems I had 

I had little problems when it comes to building a website, I had forgotten some of the Html and CSS knowledge that I had.

## Solution
I was able to do revise some of the Html and CSS that I did in the freecodecamp which was useful in helping me to understand in building my website.

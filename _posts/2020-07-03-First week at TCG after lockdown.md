## Introduction

Today I will be sharing about what I have learned in the first week of TCG after lockdown regarding Javascript and CSS flexbox .

## Body

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.

It is also one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS that you may have learned previously. This section will cover basic JavaScript programming concepts, which range from variables and arithmetic to objects and loops.JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object. And also in JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive, this means that capitalization matters.

### What is CSS flexbox?

Flexbox model provides for an efficient way to layout, align, and distribute space among elements within your document â€” even when the viewport and the size of your elements are dynamic or unknown.

To use the flexbox you need to set the parent element (flex container) to [display: flex or inline flex ]and the child/children elements within flex container
are known as flex items.

### Flex container properties

-flex-direction 
-flex-wrap
-flew-flow
-justify-content
-Align-items
-Align-content

### flex-direction

Decides how the flex items are laid out.

Examples 
-row
-column
-row-reverse
-column-reverse

### Flex-wrap
when the available space within the flex container can no longer house the flex items in their widths, the flex-wrap breaks unto multiple lines.

Examples

-wrap(default)
-No-wrap
-wrap-reverse

### Flex-flow

Flex-flow is a shorthand property which takes flex-direction and flex-wrap values.

### Justify-content

Defines how flex items are laid out on the main axis.

Examples 

-flex-start
-flex-end 
-center
-space-between
-space-around

### Align-items

Defines how flex items are laid out on the cross axis.

Examples

-flex-start
-flex-end
-center
-stretch
-baseline

## Conclusion

The week was hectic because it has been a while since I did any type of coding practice.

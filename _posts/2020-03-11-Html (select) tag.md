## Introduction

I going to share what I learned regarding the HTML "select" tag.

## Body

### Html (select) tag 

html (select) tag is used to create a drop-down list of options, which appears when the user clicks on a form element, and it allows a cone of the option. The (option) tag is used to define the possible options to 
choose from, which is put into the (select) tag.

The first option from the list of options is selected by default. The change a predefined option, the selected attribute is used. The (optgroup) tag is used to group several options into one group. The content
of (optgroup) looks like heading in bold. The look of the list depends on the "size" attribute, which defines the height of the list. The width of the list depends on the length of the text inside (option). The width can
also be regulated with CSS styles.

## Conclusion

If I was not doing the Freecodecamp project which wanted me to create a survey form, I think it would have taken me a long time to know the (select) tag. It showed me that I was sometimes ignorant of things because I simply rely too much on freecodecamp instead of being ahead of it and teaching myself more.

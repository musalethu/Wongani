## What is justified text?


Justified text is alignment of text within a column or measure to align against the left and right margin. 

## When is it used?

justified text is commonly used in printed media as newspaper, book, leaflets etc, where the straight line on
each margin can be used successfully to guide the across columns of text.

  ## Why I justified text on websites a bad idea?

When using justified text for print, the designer has complete control over how the user will see the content. 
However, with the many combination of website browsers (and versions) on many different operating systems, a 
website designer can not be certain how the justified text will be rendered on the screen.

 Visually impaired users often use screen magnifiers to enlarge text to a suitable level. Many magnifiers work 
 by enlarging the area around your mouse. Because the large uneven spaces are also magnified it can become difficult 
 for the to follow the words with their magnifying software.

 The Royal National Institute of Blind people (RNIB) strongly recommend websites do not use justified text. Modern 
 websites are all about the user.

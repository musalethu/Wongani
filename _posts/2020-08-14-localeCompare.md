## Introduction

I will share about the localeCompare

## Body

### What is the string.localeCompare?

The string.localeCompare() is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which is used to compare any two elements and returns a positive number if the reference string is lexicographically greater than the compare string and negative number if the reference string is lexicographically smaller than the compare string and zero (0) if the compare and reference strings are equivalent.

### Syntax 

In JavaScript, the syntax for the localeCompare() method is:

referenceString.localeCompare(compare_string [, locale [, options]]);


### Returns

The localeCompare() method returns a negative number if the calling string appears before the compare_string in the sort order.

The localeCompare() method returns a positive number if the calling string appears after the compare_string in the sort order.

The localeCompare() method returns 0 if the calling string is equivalent to the compare_string and thus appears at the same position in the sort order.

## Conclusion 

Learning this method was helpful because it helped when it came to comparing individual alphabets when I was writing my test.

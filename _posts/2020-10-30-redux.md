## Introduction

I will share about Redux.

## Body 

### What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state container for Javascript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great experience, such as live code editing combined with a time-traveling debugger and it is built on top of functional programming. Also, Redux can be used together with React.

### Create a React Redux app:

npx create-react-app my-app --template redux

### Benefits of Redux

- Predictable state updates

Make it easier to understand how the data flow works in the application.

- Maintainability 

Having a predictable outcome and strict structure makes the code easier to maintain.

- Organization

Redux is stricter about how code should be organized, which makes code more consistent and easier for a team to work with.

- Server rendering 

This very useful, especially for the initial render, making for a better user experience or search engine optimization. Just pass the store created on the server to the client-side.

## Conclusion 

Redux helps us in these tricky scenarios where multiple components want to share some or all of the same data, but are no closely related to one another. Redux provides a central store that can hold data from anywhere in the application.

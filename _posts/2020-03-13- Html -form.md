### Html form

 An HTML form is a section of a document containing form elements. Form elements are various types of input elements,
 such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, labels, and so on. The HTML <form> tag is used for
 declaring a form. This tag comes in pairs. The special elements which are called controls are written between opening form and closing form tags. 

 The following form elements are use to create a form:

 -input
 -button
 -textarea
 -select
 -label
 -option
 -fieldset

# Introduction

I will be sharing about what I did in the week.

# Body

This week I have learned about Json.parsa, which converts strings to objects, also the Json.stringify which converts objects back to strings and the "const" which does not define a constant value, but defines a constant reference to value and it's the same as "let". I was also introduced to two types of loops which are namely "for" and "while".

## while loop

The while loop specifies condition if the condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

## for loop

The for loop has three optional expressions which are (Initialization, Condition, final-expression).

### Initialization

-Execute one time only before the loop starts and it used to define and stop loop value.

### Condition

-It is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and continues if the evaluation is true.

### Final-expression

Is executed at the end of every loop iteration and it's used to increment or decrement the loop counter.

# Conclusion

All I can say is that the week was not easy because we had an assignment and a test to write which was not easy, but above all, I managed to create a functioning calculator that I'm proud of.

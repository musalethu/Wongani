## What is Flexbox?

Flexbox is a single dimensional layout,which means that it lays items in one dimension at a time, either as a row,as a column, but not 
both together. This can be opposed to the two-dimensional model-CSS GRID layout, which lays the in the items in two dimensions simultaneously
(rows and columns together).

Flexbox is mention as an alternative to CSS floats for setting  the the overall appearance of a webpage.Flexbox comes with many benefits, in
particular, with it you can control alignment, direction, order, and size of items.

The items inside a flex container:

-can be organized in any direction (leftwards, rightwards, downwards or even upwards) (flex-direction).
-can have direct (left-to-right) or reversed (right-to-left) order.
-can have “flex” width and height to fill the available space (flex-item).
-can be set to dynamically collapse or expand along the main axis, and in the meantime preserve the size of the secondary cross axis.
-can be organized linearly along the main axis or wrapped into multiple lines along or across the cross axis.

Flexbox is relatively new, but it enjoys excellent browser support today (nearly 83% of browsers support it).

## Introduction

I going to share about what I learnt regarding the the html "select" tag.

## Body

###Html<select>tag 

html<select>tag is used to create drop down list of options, which appears when the user clicks on form
element, and it allows to cone of the option.The <option> tag is used to define the possible options to 
choose from, which is put into the <select>tag.

The first option from the list of option is selected by default.The to change a predefined option, the 
selected attribute is used.The <optgroup> tag is used to group several options into one group.The content
of <optgroup> looks like heading in bold.The look of the list depends on the "size" attribute, which defines 
the height of the list. The width of the list depends on the length of the text inside <option>. The width can
also be regulated with CSS styles.

## Conclusion

If I was not doing the Freecodecamp project which wanted me to created a survey form, I think it would have taken me 
a long time to know is the <select>tag. It showed me that I was ignorant of thing ,because I simply rely too much on 
freecodecamp instead of being ahead of freecodecamp and teaching myself more.

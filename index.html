          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p> A little about myself, I live in a family of four and my the youngest in house.<br> I matriculated at Sunrise Secondary School and most of the subject I did at school were bored as I just did,
        because I had no other options.<br> So my passion for having the desire to becoming  progammer was because I was introduced to the field of programming in 2016,<br> by my old brother at that time he was 
        doing his 2nd year.<br> At that time it was when I started teaching myself c++ through youtube tutorial.<br> Being part of the "The Coding Ground" to me I see it as opportunity to expand on the litte knowledge
        by learning many other programming.</p>
